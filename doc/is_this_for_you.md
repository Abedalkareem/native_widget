What does that mean?

When the user start the app at some point you should create the widgets and feed them to the plugin to be shown in the system widgets screen, so when the user add the widget to the home screen the system will not call your app to get the data, it will just show the data you provided to it.

As an example, if you have a game and you want to show the user the current lives he has, you can create a widget that shows the lives and feed it to the system, let's say at that time the user had 1 lives and you know after 1 hour he will have another live added and after 2 hours a third live will be added, you can create 3 widgets and feed them to the system, so when the user add the widget to the home screen he will see the current live and after 1 hour the widget will update to show the second live and after 2 hours it will show the third live.
